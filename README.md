# Emergence

*In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence is the condition of an entity having properties its parts do not have, due to interactions among the parts.*






## About

This project explores the concept of emergence through 5 interactive simulations. The 5 simulations revolve around questions – What causes traffic? How do fish avoid predators? - that connect to the underlying emergent systems. 

*Emergence* was created as a senior capstone project for the Washington University in St. Louis Communication Design Program. It was designed and developed by Lucas Drummond.

This projet is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/ianmcgregor/boid). 

This project explores specific coding concepts in development

- intelligent agents (in this case, [boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/))
- html canvas based rendering and animations. 

### Libraries
